# Project: Art Creation using Neural Stye Transfer
Coded in Google Colab, this project features Neural Style Transfer which is an optimization technique that merges two images, namely: a "content" image (C) and a "style" image (S), to create a "generated" image (G). The generated image G combines the "content" of the image C with the "style" of image S. Neural Style Transfer (NST) uses a previously trained convolutional network, and builds on top of that. The pre-trained CNN is the VGG network from the original NST paper published by the Visual Geometry Group at University of Oxford in 2014. Specifically, VGG-19 is used, which is a a 19-layer version of the VGG network. This model has already been trained on the very large ImageNet database, and has learned to recognize a variety of low level features (at the shallower layers) and high level features (at the deeper layers).
